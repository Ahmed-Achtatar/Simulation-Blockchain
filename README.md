# What is it about?
```
- first folder is a basic simulation about the blockchain using basic html/css/js
- seconde folder is the main project: a simulation that shows how we add a second layer of security (blockchain) 
to the old layer that concerns PDF files integrity and security (digital certificates).
```

# Project contains:
```
*// Signing PDF files and generating hashes and all the data stored in the blockchain
*// Generating Qr code for the specified block in the blockchain and adding it to the PDF
*// All blockchain operations(mining blocks, generating nonce, verifying blocks, timestamps...)
*// Verification of a PDF file on upload (verifies signature and if there is a copy in the blockchain)

```
# Techs used:
```
Angular, Composer libs, bootstrap..
